In the small town of Raesfeld, a curious tourist named Jack decided to start his day by visiting a local Baeckerei to try their famous Apfelkuchen.
While savoring the delicious cake, he noticed a Hund wearing sunglasses, confidently strutting down the Hauptstrasse like it owned the place.
Intrigued, Jack followed the dog, which led him to a lively Biergarten, where a man dressed in Lederhose was attempting to eat a massive Bratwurst in one bite.
Suddenly, a group of musicians appeared, blasting Rammstein songs while balancing on unicycles near a majestic Schloss, causing everyone in the Biergarten to cheer as they raised their Bratwurst and Brot in celebration
Jack joined the excitement until a mysterious woman in a Dirndel approached him and handed him a flyer for the annual wettbewerbsfaehig pastry competition.
Curious, he walked to the competition venue, which turned out to be inside the majestic Schloss Eltz, a castle that looked like it came straight out of a fairy tale.
The challenge was to make the perfect Gebaeck, but Jack had no idea how to bake, so he decided to improvise with leftover pieces of Brot and apple slices.
His hund  was not a fan of his improvised Brot so he tore his Lederhose off and ran away in Jacks Porsche.
During the judging, chaos broke out when someone spilled beer from their BMW, and it rolled into a table, knocking over all the pastries.
Amid the commotion, Jack sneaked a piece of Doener from the catering table, only to discover it was spicier than expected, leaving him gulping down water.
To calm his burning mouth, he wandered into a hidden room in the castle where the air was refreshingly cool thanks to a vintage Klimaanlage.
He met a woman named Rammstein,after the famous band, wearing a Dirndel and reading a recipe book.
Jack left the castle with the recipe book in hand, determined to learn German and conquer the pastry world someday. 
His trip ended with a flight from the Flughafen in Berlin, where he laughed to himself, wondering if anyone would believe his strange and delicious adventure.
After reminiscing he couldn't help himself but go to a local Baeckerei for some sweet Apfelkuchen.
